Pandoc is open-source software, maintained by volunteers working
in their free time.  Please keep that in mind when asking for
help.

The first place to go if you have a question about pandoc, or
if something doesn't seem to be working properly, is the
[pandoc-discuss mailing list] on Google Groups. (The mailing
list is also mirrored on [gmane].)  This list has over 1500
members, and more often than not, someone will answer your
question quickly.

If you think you've found a bug in pandoc, you can create an
issue on the [github bug tracker].  But unless you're sure it's
a bug, it's good to raise the issue on pandoc-discuss first.
See the [guidelines on contributing] for some suggestions
about how to write a useful bug report.

Suggestions for enhancements to pandoc (for example, new
formats, options, or structural elements) should always be
discussed on the mailing list before an issue is created on
the github tracker.

People often ask questions about pandoc on [stackoverflow].  But
the main pandoc developers do not monitor this site, so you're
likely to get better responses if you post on
[pandoc-discuss][pandoc-discuss mailing list].
